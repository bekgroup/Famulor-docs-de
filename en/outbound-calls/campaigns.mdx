An outbound "campaign" determines when, how, and to whom calls are made.

## 1. Setup a Campaign

1. **Go to Outbound / Campaigns** in your dashboard.
2. Click **Create New Campaign**:
   - **Name**: e.g. "January Promo," "Payment Reminder," etc.
   - **Assistant**: which AI assistant will handle these calls?
   - **Window**: choose the time window for the campaign
   - **Phone Numbers**: assign one or multiple phone numbers to the campaign (see Phone Number Pool below)

## 2. Phone Number Pool for Campaigns

**New Feature (October 12, 2025)**: You can now assign multiple phone numbers to a single campaign. The system will automatically rotate the outgoing caller ID for each call, which can significantly improve answer rates.

### How It Works

- **Multiple Number Assignment**: Assign 2 or more phone numbers to any campaign
- **Automatic Rotation**: Each call to a lead uses a different number from your pool
- **Better Connection Rates**: Varying caller IDs increases the likelihood that recipients will answer the phone

### Setting Up Phone Number Pool

You can assign multiple phone numbers in two ways:

1. **During Campaign Creation**: 
   - When creating a new campaign, use the **Phone Numbers** field
   - Select multiple numbers from your available pool

2. **From Campaign Overview**: 
   - After saving your campaign, go to the campaign overview
   - Click **Assign Phone Numbers** or edit the campaign
   - Select multiple numbers to add to the rotation pool

Once configured, the system automatically rotates through your assigned numbers for each outbound call, ensuring leads see different caller IDs throughout the campaign.

## 3. Importing Leads

- **CSV File**: Upload phone numbers (plus any extra columns, like name or account number).
- **Google Sheets**: Connect via the no-code platform or direct integration to pull leads.
- **CRM**: Some CRMs (HubSpot, GHL, etc.) can send leads directly to famulor.de via API or automation.

## 4. Call Retries & Scheduling

- **Max Retries**: e.g., attempt each lead up to 2 times if they don't answer.
- **Retry Interval**: minutes/hours between retries.
- **Time Window**: e.g., only call between 9 AM and 6 PM local time to avoid inconveniencing leads.

## 5. Monitoring & Pausing

- Once the campaign is live, calls happen automatically during the allowed hours.
- You can **pause** or **stop** the campaign anytime to revise your script or leads list.

## 6. Analyzing Results

- Visit **Campaign Reports** to see:
  - How many calls were answered vs. no-answer.
  - Number of successful vs. failed calls.
  - Average call duration, etc.

**Note:** Large campaigns with thousands of leads can run concurrently, as AI can handle parallel calls. Watch your minute usage to avoid unexpected costs.
