# Pricing Breakdown

famulor.de uses a **minutes-based** system for billing. These minutes (or tokens/credits) get **deducted** from your balance each time you make or receive a call. The actual “per-minute cost” depends on your plan, and **carrier costs** are also converted into minutes. Below is how it works.

---

## 1. Inbound vs. Outbound Calls

- **Inbound**: You spend minutes as soon as the AI assistant picks up and is engaged in a call.
- **Outbound**: Minutes start deducting once the customer answers the call and stays connected. Dial time is not billed.

> **Note**: A call is considered active until the AI or the user hangs up, **or** until voicemail detection ends the call if the user’s voicemail answers (for outbound).

---

## 2. How Minutes Are Used

### a) AI Spoken Time

- If your AI assistant is actively on the call for 1 minute, you consume **1 minute** of AI time.
- The cost is **prorated** by the second, so a 30-second call uses 0.5 minutes from your plan (for AI time).

### b) Carrier Conversion

- **Carrier cost** (the telecom network fee) is also deducted from your balance **but** is typically **rounded up** to the next minute.
- We convert the carrier's euro amount to minutes at your plan's rate.
  - **Example**: If your carrier charge is €0.05 for a 1-minute call, and your plan's AI rate is €0.10/min, we convert that €0.05 to 0.5 minutes from your balance.

**So a single 1-minute conversation might consume:**

- **1 AI minute** (for the assistant)
- **+ 0.5 "carrier minutes"** (converted from the carrier's €0.05 to half your AI cost).
- **= 1.5 minutes total** deducted from your plan balance.

## 3. Per-Second Billing vs. Rounding

1. **AI Time**

   - **Measured per second**, so 70 seconds is ~1.17 minutes of AI usage.
   - Deducted exactly from your plan’s minute balance.

2. **Carrier Time**
   - **Rounded to next full minute** for the network fee.
   - Then converted into a fraction of your AI plan cost to decide how many “minutes” to deduct from your credit balance.

## 4. Included Minutes & Top-Ups

- **Each Plan**: Usually includes a monthly allotment of minutes.
- **Using Up Minutes**: Once you exceed included minutes, **additional minutes are NOT automatically charged**. You need to manually add credit to your account.
- **Adding Credit**: Go to **"Guthaben hinzufügen"** (Add Credit) in the right sidebar of your dashboard. From there, you can either:
  - **Purchase credit manually**: Buy additional minutes at your plan's rate whenever needed.
  - **Enable Auto Top-up**: Activate automatic credit replenishment to ensure you never run out of minutes.
- **No Rollover**: Unused minutes typically don't roll over to the next month.

**Example**

> You're on the **Starter Plan** with 100 included minutes (€49/month):
>
> - If you make enough calls that total 80 AI minutes + carrier conversions = 80 used, you have 20 left this month.
> - Next month, you reset to 100. If you need 110 minutes, you must manually add credit via "Guthaben hinzufügen" and purchase 10 extra minutes at €0.40/min, or enable Auto Top-up to have this done automatically.

## 5. Volume Discounts or Tiers

- Plans vary (e.g., **Flex** at €0.50/min, **Starter** at €0.40/min, **Business** at €0.15/min, **Scale** at €0.11/min).
- High-volume usage (like 50,000+ minutes/month) can often get **bulk discounts** by contacting sales.

## 6. Quick Usage Examples

### Example A (Outbound Call, Starter Plan)

- **AI Rate**: €0.40/min (after included 100 minutes)
- **Call Duration**: 30 seconds → 0.5 AI minutes = €0.20 AI cost.
- **Carrier**: €0.01/min, but 30 seconds → 1 minute rounded up → €0.01.
  - €0.01 at your plan's €0.40 rate = 0.025 "plan minutes" used (Or if you do a simpler approach, €0.01 / €0.40 = 0.025 minutes)
- **Total**: 0.5 (AI) + 0.025 (carrier) = 0.525 minutes from your plan. If you had 100 included, you'd have 99.475 left.

### Example B (Inbound Call, Business Plan)

- **AI Rate**: €0.15/min (after included 600 minutes)
- **Call Duration**: 90 seconds → 1.5 AI minutes = €0.225 AI cost.
- **Carrier**: Suppose inbound is €0.015/min, rounding up to 2 minutes if the call was 1.5 min. That's €0.03 total.
  - €0.03 / €0.15 = 0.2 minutes from your plan.
- **Total**: 1.5 (AI) + 0.2 (carrier) = 1.7 minutes deducted.

### FAQ

- **Do I pay double if user + AI talk simultaneously?**  
  **No**, it's based on total call duration, not per speaker concurrency.
- **What if someone picks up then instantly hangs up?**  
  The AI might register a few seconds; cost is fractional for the AI, but carrier may round up to 1 minute.
- **I see the error "Insufficient balance to cover potential call costs: insufficient_balance_for_cost" even though I have credit - why?**  
  Famulor calculates the required credit based on the **maximum duration time of the assistant** plus the **maximum carrier cost**. If this calculated amount is higher than your existing credit balance, the call cannot start. This pre-authorization ensures you have sufficient funds to complete the call. You can adjust the maximum conversation duration in the assistant settings page, or add more credit via **"Guthaben hinzufügen"** to proceed.

---

**Bottom Line**  
All calls burn **AI time** plus a **converted carrier cost** from your plan's minute balance. Keep track of usage in your dashboard. When you need additional minutes, manually add credit via **"Guthaben hinzufügen"** in the right sidebar, or enable Auto Top-up for automatic replenishment. Choose the plan that best suits your volume.
