## What is a Flow?

A **flow** is an automation workflow that connects triggers (events that start the flow) with actions (tasks that execute when triggered). Flows help you automate post-call processing, integrate with external systems, and enhance your AI calling capabilities.

## Understanding Flow Components

### Trigger: The Starting Point

The **trigger** is the event that starts your flow. It determines when and how often the flow executes.

**Available Trigger Types:**

- **Call Ended Trigger**: Activates when an AI call completes
- **Inbound Call Variable Injection**: Triggers before the AI assistant picks up an incoming call
- **Schedule Trigger**: Runs at specific times or intervals
- **Webhook Trigger**: Activates when an external system sends a webhook
- **Event Trigger**: Responds to specific service events

<Info>
Each trigger provides different data and context. For example, the "Call Ended" trigger gives you access to the full conversation transcript, call duration, and outcome.

### Action: What Happens Next

**Actions** define what occurs when the flow is activated. They control the automation tasks that execute after the trigger fires.

**Common Action Types:**

- **CRM Updates**: Update HubSpot, Salesforce, or other CRM systems
- **Data Storage**: Save call data to Google Sheets, databases, or files
- **Notifications**: Send emails, SMS, or Slack messages
- **Webhooks**: Trigger external APIs or custom integrations
- **Campaign Management**: Add leads to campaigns or update lead status
- **Code Execution**: Run custom JavaScript code for complex logic

## Real-World Flow Example

**Example: Post-Call CRM Update Flow**

1. **Trigger**: Call Ended
2. **Action 1**: Extract key information from transcript (e.g., customer name, inquiry type)
3. **Action 2**: Update HubSpot contact with call outcome
4. **Action 3**: Send email notification to sales team if lead is qualified

## Best Practices for Building Flows

### Start Simple

Begin with a single trigger and one action. Test thoroughly before adding complexity.

### Use Variables Effectively

Leverage data from triggers (like call transcripts or lead information) to personalize actions.

### Handle Errors

Add error handling for actions that might fail (API timeouts, invalid data, etc.).

### Test Your Flows

Use the debugging tools to test flows before deploying them to production.
