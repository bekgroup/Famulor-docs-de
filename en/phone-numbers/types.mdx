famulor.de lets you connect three different kinds of phone numbers to your AI assistant:

1. **Normal (Dedicated) Numbers**

   - Rented directly from famulor.de.
   - Can be used for **both inbound** and **outbound** calls.
   - Typically charged as a monthly rental, with the ability to handle multiple parallel calls on a single number.

2. **SIP Integration (VOIP/PBX)**

   - Connect an existing VOIP or PBX number via SIP.
   - This setup allows you to keep your existing numbers while benefiting from famulor.de's AI.
   - Works for **both inbound and outbound**—but requires you to share SIP credentials or trunk details with us to configure.
   - To submit a request, contact us through the chat widget in the bottom right corner of the screen inside the app.

3. **Caller ID (Outbound Only)**
   - When you already have a phone number (e.g., your personal or business line) but don't want to port it or integrate via SIP.
   - You verify ownership (via OTP or a short call) so that number can appear on people's caller ID.
   - **Inbound calls won't be answered by the AI** if you use Caller ID alone—it only masks the AI's outbound calls.

- **Only outbound calls?** Use **Caller ID** to verify your existing number, or rent a **Dedicated Number** for better analytics.
- **Have existing infrastructure?** **SIP Integration** lets you keep your current numbers while adding AI capabilities.
