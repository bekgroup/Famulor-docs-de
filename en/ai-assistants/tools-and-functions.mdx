famulor.de offers built-in **tools** that your AI assistant can use during a call. These tools help you shape the conversation flow and automate actions like transferring calls, scheduling appointments, or ending conversations.

## What are Tools?

Tools are capabilities that extend your AI assistant's functionality beyond basic conversation. They allow the assistant to:
- Take specific actions during calls
- Integrate with external systems
- Control call flow and routing
- Automate follow-up tasks

## Available Tools

### 1. End Call Tool

**Purpose**: Tells the AI to politely wrap up the conversation when appropriate conditions are met.

**How It Works**: 
- You specify in the system prompt when to end the call
- Example: "If the user says 'goodbye' or 'thank you, that's all I need', end the call politely."

**Configuration**: 
- In the assistant's settings, define conditions that trigger the end call
- The AI will say a closing message before ending

**Use Cases**:
- Customer service calls that are resolved
- Information requests that are completed
- Appointment confirmations

### 2. Transfer Tool

**Purpose**: Moves the caller from the AI assistant to a human agent or external phone number.

**How It Works**:
- AI recognizes when escalation is needed (based on your prompt)
- Transfers the call to the configured number or department
- Optionally plays a hold message during transfer

**Configuration**:
- Add the phone number or department in assistant settings
- Configure a short hold message (optional)
- Define transfer conditions in your system prompt

**Use Cases**:
- Warm leads on sales calls that need human follow-up
- Complex support issues requiring escalation
- Technical problems beyond AI's capabilities

<Info>
The transfer tool can route to specific departments, phone numbers, or queue systems. Configure multiple transfer options for different scenarios.

### 3. Appointment Scheduler (Cal.com Integration)

**Purpose**: Lets the AI check your calendar availability and book appointments directly during the call.

**How It Works**:
1. AI offers scheduling based on your prompt
2. Caller selects preferred date and time
3. AI checks availability via Cal.com or Google Calendar
4. AI confirms the appointment and sends confirmation (email/SMS if configured)

**Setup**: 
- Connect your Cal.com account in assistant settings
- Configure available time slots and preferences
- Add scheduling instructions to your system prompt

**Use Cases**:
- Sales qualification calls that result in demos
- Customer support that requires follow-up calls
- Consultation booking

### 4. No-Code Automation Platform Integration

**Purpose**: After or during calls, the AI can trigger actions in the automation platform for post-call processing.

**How It Works**:
- Link your assistant with automation flows
- Choose triggers like "Call Ended" or "Customer Agrees"
- Select actions (CRM updates, emails, data logging)

**Available Actions**:
- **CRM Updates**: Update HubSpot, Salesforce contacts
- **Data Storage**: Save to Google Sheets, databases
- **Notifications**: Send emails, SMS, Slack messages
- **Webhooks**: Trigger external APIs
- **Campaign Management**: Add leads to campaigns

**Setup**:
1. Go to the "Automation" tab in your assistant settings
2. Choose triggers (Call Ended, specific keywords, etc.)
3. Select actions from available integrations
4. Configure data mapping and conditions

## Combining Multiple Tools

Tools can be combined to create sophisticated call flows. For example:

**Example Flow:**
1. AI answers call and qualifies lead
2. If qualified, AI schedules appointment using Cal.com tool
3. If caller wants more info, AI transfers to sales team
4. After call ends, automation platform updates CRM
