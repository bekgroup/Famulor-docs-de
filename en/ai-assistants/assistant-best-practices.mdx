Getting great results often comes down to picking the right engine settings. Use this checklist when configuring a Famulor assistant.

## 1. Pick a Mode

| Mode | Why choose it? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Speech-to-Speech (Multimodal) | Fastest turn-taking and most natural flow | Recommended starting point. Try the Gemini 2.5 engine (beta) for the lowest latency, but note it’s experimental and may be less stable. |
| Pipeline | Maximum control over voice and long-form replies | If you select Pipeline, continue to the Transcriber step below. |

Want to know more about the differences? See the [Assistant Modes guide](/ai-assistants/assistant-modes).

<Tip>
Record the same scenario in both modes and compare response time and caller satisfaction.
</Tip>

## 2. Choose a Transcriber (Pipeline only)

| Transcriber | Accuracy | Latency | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Azure | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ | ⏱️⏱️⏱️ (slower) | Highest transcription fidelity |
| Gladia | ⭐️⭐️⭐️ | ⏱️ (faster) | Good all-rounder for most languages |
| Deepgram | ⭐️⭐️⭐️ | ⏱️ (faster) | Solid alternative—test which performs better for your language and audio setup |

<Tip>
Different languages, accents, and background noise can affect each engine differently. Run a quick A/B test and keep the best performer.
</Tip>

## 3. Select an LLM Model

| Model | Strengths | Trade-offs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPT-4o | Smartest reasoning, handles complex prompts | Slightly higher latency and cost |
| Gemini 2.5-Flash-Lite | Blazing-fast, still highly capable | May miss nuance in very complex tasks—test for your use case |

<Tip>
If speed is critical, start with Gemini 2.5-Flash-Lite. For sophisticated reasoning, use GPT-4o and offset latency by shortening replies.
</Tip>

## 4. Noise Cancellation

If callers are on speaker phone or in a quiet environment, keep noise cancellation ON. If your call volume is low or some words are “clipped,” turn it OFF so the transcriber gets the full waveform.

<Tip>
If the assistant isn’t hearing you well, try turning noise cancellation off.
</Tip>

## 5. Conversation Timers

| Parameter | Recommended | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Re-engagement | ≈ 30 s | Gives callers enough time to think. Lower values can feel pushy. |
| Max silence duration | ≈ 60 s | Prevents premature hang-ups while still ending truly silent calls. |

<Info>
Test different values in real calls—too low can interrupt, too high leaves awkward gaps.
</Info>

## 6. Initial Message

| Mode | How it’s used | Best practice |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pipeline | Read exactly as written (converted by TTS) | Write the greeting verbatim: “Hello, this is Alex from …”. |
| Speech-to-Speech | Interpreted as a prompt by the model | Include instructions like “Greet the customer and say …” or prepend `say exactly:` to ensure literal output. |

## 7. Ambient sound

Ambient sound adds subtle background noise to the assistant’s voice and is enabled by default.

<Tip>
If the assistant isn’t hearing you well, turn off ambient sound or lower the ambient volume.
</Tip>

## 8. Endpointing sliders

Control when your assistant starts talking with the endpointing sensitivity slider at the bottom of assistant settings.

| Setting | Effect | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lower sensitivity | Assistant responds faster after caller stops speaking | You want snappy, quick-turn conversations |
| Higher sensitivity | Assistant waits longer before responding | Callers give longer, more detailed replies |

<Tip>
If your assistant cuts off callers mid-sentence, increase sensitivity. If responses feel sluggish, decrease it.
</Tip>

## 9. Debug using the call transcript

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Call history">
Go to the Call history page in your dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Select your latest test call">
Open the most recent call you placed for this assistant.
</Step>

<Step title="Inspect transcript and function calls">
Review the transcript, function calls, and parameters to identify timing or logic issues.

<Check>
Confirm the assistant is using the expected mode, model, and tools per your configuration.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>
