---

Famulor AI assistants support two voice generation modes. Each mode affects how caller speech is processed and how replies are generated.

<Info>
Latency varies by language, model, and network conditions. Values below are typical ranges.
</Info>

### Quick comparison

| Mode | How it works | Typical latency | Best for | Voice options |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pipeline | Speech-to-Text → LLM → Text-to-Speech | ~800–1500 ms | Complex reasoning, dynamic prompts, multi-sentence replies | All library voices, including custom-cloned |
| Speech-to-Speech (Multimodal) | Direct speech-to-speech generation (no intermediate text) | ~300–600 ms | Snappy back-and-forth, short and reactive replies | Limited set; expanding over time |

## 1. Pipeline

- **Label in UI**: Pipeline
- **How it works**: Speech-to-Text → LLM → Text-to-Speech
- **Latency**: ~800 – 1500 ms (depends on language & model)
- **Best for**: Complex reasoning, dynamic prompts, multi-sentence replies

Pipeline mode first transcribes the caller’s words into text, runs that text through the language model, then converts the response back to audio. It’s a flexible approach that offers maximum control:

- Supports all voices in the library (including custom-cloned voices).
- Handles long-form answers or paragraph-style responses well.
- Allows the LLM to inject variables and reference earlier context cleanly.

### When to choose Pipeline

- You need rich, multi-sentence answers (e.g., support queries, detailed explanations).
- The assistant must reason over structured data or complex prompts.
- You prefer absolute control of the spoken voice (clone or brand voice).

<Tip>
Use Pipeline when brand voice consistency matters or when your prompts rely on structured data lookups.

## 2. Speech-to-Speech (Multimodal)

- **Label in UI**: Speech-to-speech
- **How it works**: Direct speech-to-speech generation (no intermediate text)
- **Latency**: ~300 – 600 ms (ultra low)
- **Best for**: Natural back-and-forth, short & reactive replies

Speech-to-speech mode skips separate transcription and TTS. Instead, it uses a multimodal model that listens and speaks directly, producing more conversational flow:

- Fast turn-taking – callers experience near-instant responses.
- Generates more expressive prosody natively (intonation, fillers).
- Currently supports a limited voice set, but more are added regularly.

### When to choose Speech-to-Speech

- The conversation needs to feel snappy (sales, booking confirmations).
- Your replies are generally short sentences or quick acknowledgements.
- You’re okay with the system-provided voice options for faster interaction.

<Warning>
If you need a custom-cloned voice, long-form responses, or advanced prompt logic, prefer Pipeline.
</Warning>

## Switching modes

Test both modes and pick the best balance of speed and quality for your use case.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open assistant settings">
Go to Assistant → Settings → Voice Engine for the specific assistant.
</Step>

<Step title="Select a mode">
Choose **Pipeline** or **Speech-to-speech** based on conversation style and latency needs.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose a voice (if using Pipeline)">
Select a built-in voice or a custom-cloned voice. See: [Voice Selection & Voice Cloning](/ai-assistants/voice-selection).
</Step>

<Step title="Place a quick test call">
Record two short calls—one per mode—covering your most common scenarios.

<Check>
Confirm acceptable latency, turn-taking, and tone consistency.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Decide and roll out">
Pick the mode that best fits your flow and keep monitoring call recordings for quality.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Record two calls—one in each mode—and compare perceived latency and engagement to decide what fits your flow.
</Tip>
