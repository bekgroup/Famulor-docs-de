This endpoint allows you to purchase a phone number that was found via the [Search endpoint](/api-reference/phone-numbers/search). The platform automatically handles pricing, billing, and provisioning.

<Note>
You must have a valid payment method on file before you can purchase a phone number. The purchase creates a monthly subscription that automatically renews.

### How It Works

1. **Search** - First use the [Search endpoint](/api-reference/phone-numbers/search) to find available numbers
2. **Purchase** - Submit the desired phone number to this endpoint
3. **Automatic Processing** - The platform:
   * Validates that the number is still available
   * Determines the correct price based on the country
   * Creates a monthly subscription on your payment method
   * Provisions the number with our telephony provider
   * Creates the phone number record in your account

<Warning>
Phone number purchases are non-refundable. The subscription will continue until you [release](/api-reference/phone-numbers/release) the number.
</Warning>
