### Webhook Behavior

When webhooks are disabled:

- No more HTTP POST requests will be sent to your webhook URL
- Both `is_webhook_active` becomes `false` and `webhook_url` is set to `null`
- Ongoing calls will complete normally, but no notifications will be sent
- Call data remains accessible via the API calls endpoints

### Notes

- The assistant must belong to your account
- This completely removes the webhook configuration
- You can re-enable webhooks later using the enable webhook endpoint with a new URL
- Disabling webhooks doesn't affect call recording or data collection
