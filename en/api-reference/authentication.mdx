All Famulor API endpoints require authentication via API keys. Include your API key in every request using the Authorization header.

## Getting Your API Key

Follow these steps to create an API key:

1. Sign in to your account at [https://app.famulor.de](https://app.famulor.de)
2. Go to the API Keys section
3. Click "Create new API Key"
4. Save your API key securely - you won't be able to view it again

<Warning>
  Protect your API key like a password. Never expose it in public repositories, 
  client-side code, or share it with unauthorized parties.
</Warning>

## Authentication Header

Add your API key to the `Authorization` header using Bearer token format:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual key.

## Request Example

Here's a sample cURL command showing proper authentication:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.famulor.de/api/user/campaigns" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Remember to substitute `YOUR_API_KEY` with your real API key.
