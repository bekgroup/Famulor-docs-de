Your AI's behavior can be fine-tuned through a combination of engine settings and prompt adjustments.

## Engine Settings Impact

Different AI engine modes affect behavior:

### Fast Engine

- Quick, more conversational responses
- May occasionally miss context
- Best for: Simple interactions, sales calls
- Works great with Filler Audio for natural flow

### Standard Engine

- Balanced understanding and speed
- Good for most use cases
- Default recommendation for new assistants

### Accurate Engine

- Deep context understanding
- More thoughtful responses
- Best for: Complex support, detailed information gathering
- May have longer pauses between responses

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Why is the AI Misunderstanding Context?

**Symptoms:**
- AI gives irrelevant responses
- AI doesn't remember information mentioned earlier
- AI asks for information already provided

**Solutions:**
- Switch to **Accurate Engine** for better context understanding
- Add more context to your system prompt
- Include example conversations showing how to handle context
- Use knowledge bases for complex information retrieval

<Info>
The Accurate Engine processes more context but may have slightly longer response times. This trade-off is worth it for complex conversations.

### How to Fix Unnatural Conversation Flow?

**Symptoms:**
- Awkward pauses between responses
- AI interrupts callers
- Conversation feels robotic

**Solutions:**
- Enable **Filler Audio** for smoother transitions and natural pauses
- Use **Fast Engine** for quicker back-and-forth in sales scenarios
- Add conversation examples in your prompt showing natural dialogue
- Adjust interruption settings to allow natural turn-taking

### Why is the AI Giving Repetitive Responses?

**Symptoms:**
- AI says the same thing multiple times
- Responses lack variety
- AI doesn't adapt to different caller styles

**Solutions:**
- Review and update your system prompt with variation examples
- Add instructions like "vary your phrasing" or "use different words for similar concepts"
- Consider switching to **Standard** or **Accurate** engine for more nuanced responses
- Test with different conversation scenarios to identify patterns

## Optimization Tips

- **Sales Calls**: Fast Engine + Filler Audio for engagement
- **Customer Support**: Accurate Engine for better problem solving
- **Lead Qualification**: Standard Engine for balanced performance

## Testing Changes

After adjusting settings:

1. Use the test call feature
2. Try different conversation scenarios
3. Monitor call recordings for improvement

## Quick Reference: Engine Selection Guide

| Engine | Speed | Context Understanding | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Fast** | Very Fast (~300-600ms) | Basic | Sales calls, quick confirmations, simple Q&A |
| **Standard** | Fast (~800-1200ms) | Good | Most use cases, balanced performance |
| **Accurate** | Moderate (~1200-2000ms) | Excellent | Complex support, detailed information gathering |
